//! [Media Types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type) are a key element
//! that enables STAC to be a rich source of information for clients.
//!
//! The best practice is to use as specific of a media type as is possible (so
//! if a file is a GeoJSON then don't use a JSON media type), and to use
//! [registered](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml)
//! IANA types as much as possible.  The following table lists types that
//! commonly show up in STAC assets.
