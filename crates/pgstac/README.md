Rust interface for [pgstac](https://github.com/stac-utils/pgstac).

## Usage

In your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
pgstac = "0.3"
```

See the [documentation](https://docs.rs/pgstac) for more.

## Testing

**pgstac** needs a blank **pgstac** database for testing, so is not part of the default workspace build.
To test:

```shell
docker compose up -d
cargo test -p pgstac
docker compose down
```

Each test is run in its own transaction, which is rolled back after the test.

### Customizing the test database connection

By default, the tests will connect to the database at `postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/postgis`.
If you need to customize the connection information for whatever reason, set your `PGSTAC_RS_TEST_DB` environment variable:

```shell
PGSTAC_RS_TEST_DB=postgresql://otherusername:otherpassword@otherhost:7822/otherdbname cargo test
```

## Other info

This crate is part of the [rustac](https://github.com/stac-utils/rustac) monorepo, see its README for contributing and license information.
